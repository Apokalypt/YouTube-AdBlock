# YouTube-AdBlock

YouTube AdBlock is an ethical AD blocker for YouTube since it doesn't impact the revenue of the content creator.

## How To Install?
### Chrome
TODO

### Firefox
*This browser is not supported yet but should be later.*

## How Does It Work?

This extension does the following:
- If the AD is skippable, skip it.
- If the AD is not skippable, mute it and play it faster (16x) so that it ends quickly.
- If the AD is on a side OR over a video, hide it.

These simple operations are enough to make the ADs disappear and let you enjoy your video without being interrupted. But
it also means that the content creator will still get the revenue from the AD.
